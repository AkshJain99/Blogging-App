# Basic blog page written in Django

This [web application](https://mighty-reaches-82829.herokuapp.com/) creates a very basic blog site using Django. The site allows blog authors to create text-only blogs using the Admin site, and any logged in user to add comments via a form. Any user can list all bloggers, all blogs, and detail for bloggers and blogs (including comments for each blog).
